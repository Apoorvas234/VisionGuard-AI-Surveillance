VisionGuard
Predictive AI-Based Urban Surveillance System

VisionGuard is an AI-powered predictive surveillance system designed to transform traditional urban monitoring into proactive public safety.
It analyzes live CCTV video feeds, detects suspicious activities, predicts potential threats, and generates real-time alerts to enable early intervention.

Tagline: From Detection to Action – VisionGuard Keeps Everyone Safe

📌 Problem Statement

Modern cities rely heavily on surveillance infrastructure such as CCTV cameras, drones, and body-worn cameras.
However, most existing systems depend on manual human monitoring, leading to:

Human fatigue and errors

Delayed threat detection

Reactive response after incidents occur

A single missed threat in crowded public spaces can result in loss of life, public panic, and large-scale damage.

💡 Solution Overview

VisionGuard introduces predictive intelligence into urban surveillance by leveraging AI and Machine Learning.
Instead of passively recording footage, the system actively analyzes live video streams, identifies suspicious patterns, predicts risks, and alerts authorities in real time.

⚙️ System Workflow

Live CCTV video feeds are captured from surveillance sources

Video data is preprocessed for accuracy (frame extraction & noise removal)

AI models analyze objects, behaviors, and anomalies

Predictive analysis identifies potential threats before incidents occur

Backend logic triggers real-time alerts

Alerts and insights are displayed on a centralized admin dashboard

Events are securely logged for future analysis and reporting

🎥 Demonstration Scenario

Airport Security Example:
A person leaves an unattended bag in a crowded airport area.
VisionGuard detects the object, analyzes the context, predicts potential risk, and immediately generates an alert on the admin portal—allowing security teams to take preventive action.

“A bag left behind today, a crisis prevented tomorrow.”
